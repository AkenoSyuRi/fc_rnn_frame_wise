# fc_rnn_frame_wise

this repo implements frame-wise inference for LSTM and GRU.

when the rknn toolkit does not support the LSTM or GRU operator for some reason, we can replace them with CustomLSTM or
CustomGRU.

for more details, please refer to the main function in the corresponding scripts.
